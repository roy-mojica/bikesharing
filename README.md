# Bikesharing Analysis
Using Tableau 

## Overview of the Analysis
The Purpose of this analysis was to see if there would be need to have a bikesharing business in Des Moines. We look at data from New York City to see answer basic questions such as the following:

- What are the peak times that bikes are being used?
- What would be ideal times for maintence? 
- What is the Gender Identity of the customer base?
- What would be the busiest time of the week? 
- Would this program fucntion well in Des Moines as it does in NYC?

## Results
Please click [CitiBikes Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/shared/RSH7654QC?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link) to see the full story of this analysis. 

### Overall
Weekdays show to have the highest trip volume at 8 AM and from 5-7 PM. This shows high potential for locals to use bikesharing as well as tourists. 


You can also see that that "Subscribers", which are users who repeatedly uses CitiBikes multiple times in a year, use bikesharing the most. Having a local market, as well as a tourist market, then you would be able to see constant and continued use.
